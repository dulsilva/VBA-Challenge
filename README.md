# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 homework. The topic is VBA Scripting. 
In this Challenge, I used sources from Google to look up how to set up basic concepts on VBA Scripting and I watched class videos to help me understand how to setup my code.
I tried to upload my Excel document but my computer would not allow Git LFS to open.
